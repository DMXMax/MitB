# MitB

Monster in the box. uses the generic pifacedigitalio web server with some tweaks

So I use python3, which means installing the default pifacedigitialio and then having to update the default the /pifacecommon/spi.py file to update the transfer speed. (its correct in the pifacecommon repo I have)

then use apt install python3-pygame. Its the easiest way to install the pygame module.
